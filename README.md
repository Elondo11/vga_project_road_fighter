### Road Fighter - Verilog Arcade Game
Welcome to the Road Fighter Verilog project! This repository contains the implementation of an exciting arcade game developed as part of my second-year studies in Electrical and Software Engineering.

### Game Description
Road Fighter is a classic top-down racing game that challenges players to navigate through a busy highway while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards. The objective is to cover as much distance as possible without crashing into other vehicles or running out of fuel. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, providing an engaging and immersive gaming experience.

### Project Details
The game is implemented in Verilog, a hardware description language commonly used for digital circuit design. By leveraging the power of Verilog, the game logic, graphics, and audio components have been efficiently designed and synthesized onto an FPGA board. The game utilizes various hardware peripherals, such as push buttons for player control, VGA display for visual output, and audio speakers for sound effects.

### How to Play
To experience the thrill of Road Fighter, you will need an FPGA development board capable of running Verilog programs. Connect the necessary hardware peripherals, such as the VGA display and audio speakers, to the board. Then, using the provided control buttons, navigate your vehicle through the challenging highway, avoiding collisions and collecting rewards along the way. Be careful not to exhaust your fuel or crash into other vehicles, as this will end the game.
